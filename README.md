# 9447H-TippingPoint
9447H's code for the 2021-2022 Vex VRC Tipping Point season.

Use PROS

In addition to all this code being basically 7k's I also learned a lot from Ryan on 4253B since he is also an amazing coder.

You should just look at 7k's [code](https://github.com/kharu6883/tower_takeover) from Tower takeover instead. Basically everything I have done was from me looking at their code and copying + learning from it.

## Code Features
